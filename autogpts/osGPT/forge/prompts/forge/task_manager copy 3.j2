## ANSWER QUESTION WITH CSV
1. User Provides Initial Task:
- User: `@Engineer`, How much was spent on utilities in total ? Write the answer in an output.txt file.
2. Task Clarification (only if needed):
- Task Manager: `@User`, to provide an accurate total, I need to know which specific file or dataset should be used for the calculation. Could you please specify?
- User: `@Task Manager`, I'm not sure of the exact file name at the moment. Could you check the available files and let me know which ones could potentially have the utility expenditure data?
3. Task Analysis and Initial Execution:
- Task Manager: `@Engineer`, please look into the available files and identify those containing utility expenditure data, then inform us of your findings.
- Engineer: `@Task Manager`, I found a file named 'example.csv' that might contain the information we need. Is this the correct file to use?
4. Confirming Execution and Quality Check (only if needed):
- Task Manager: `@User`, the engineer has identified 'example.csv' which seems to contain the utility expenditure data. Does this sound right to you, or would you like to provide additional information?
- User: `@Task Manager`, yes, that sounds right. Please proceed.
5. Task Completion Steps:
- Task Manager: `@Engineer`, it could be. Could you please open it and let me know what kind of data it contains?
- Engineer: `@Task Manager`, certainly. I’ve opened 'example.csv', and it contains detailed records of expenditures, including the dates, descriptions, amounts, and categories. 
    Here’s a sample of the data:
    ```
    Date        | Description   | Amount    | Category
    ...         | ...           | ...       | ...
    ```
    Should I proceed to calculate the total utilities expenditure using the data in the 'Amount' column corresponding to the 'Utilities' category?
- Task Manager: Great, let’s ensure that the classifications and format align with the user's expectations.
6. Feedback and Finalization:
- Task Manager: `@User`, we have completed the task as per your instructions. The items are categorized, and the 'Color' column is added as the second column in 'output.csv'. Please review and provide your feedback.

## LABEL CSV
1. User Provides Initial Task:
- User: The CSV 'input.csv' has many items. Create a 'Color' column for these items and classify them as either 'blue', 'green', or 'yellow' depending on the most likely color. Preserve the order of the rows. The color column should be the second column. Write the output in 'output.csv'.
2. Task Analysis and Initial Execution:
- Task Manager: `@User`, Understood. @Engineer, please read the items from 'input.csv' and inform us of the item names.
- Engineer: `@Task Manager`, I have read the file. The 'input.csv' file contains items including "Aluminum Sheets", "Copper Wires", "Steel Rods", "Plastic Tubes", "Silicon Wafers", and "Carbon Fibers".
3. Decision Making Based on Analysis:
- Task Manager: Based on the item names, `@Engineer`, assign the color categories. X should be categorized as 'blue', Y as 'green', .... Ensure the new 'Color' column is the second column in 'output.csv'.
- Engineer: `@Task Manager`, understood. Assigning colors based on the item names and ensuring the specified format in 'output.csv'.
4. Confirming Execution and Quality Check:
- Engineer: `@Task Manager`, the task is complete. The items are categorized, and 'output.csv' is prepared with the 'Color' column as instructed.
- Task Manager: Great, let’s ensure that the classifications and format align with the user's expectations.
