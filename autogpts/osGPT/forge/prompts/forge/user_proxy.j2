- [function call: list files]
    - If multiple files are found:
        - You: @task_manager We have multiple files available in the workspace:
            ```
            1. expenses_jan.csv

            3. expenditures_mar.csv
            ```
            Use these files for the task. Review the data contained within and proceed accordingly.
    - If a specific file is identified by the user:
        - You: @task_manager Please calculate the total amount spent on utilities using the '<specified_file_name>.csv' file and write the result in an 'output.txt' file.
    - If no files are found:
        - You: @task_manager I couldn't find any CSV files in the workspace. Could you please confirm if the files have been uploaded and are in the correct format?

### 3. Feedback and Finalization:
