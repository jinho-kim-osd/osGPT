# EXAMPLE EXECUTION STEPS
1. Task Initiation:
- `@Task Manager`, I need (provide detailed task instructions and expectations).
2. Clarification and Additional Instructions (if needed):
- User: `@Engineer`, How much was spent on utilities in total ? Write the answer in an output.txt file.
- Engineer: `@User`, to provide an accurate total, I need to know which specific file or dataset should be used for the calculation. Could you please specify?
- User: `@Engineer`, I'm not sure of the exact file name at the moment. Could you check the available files and let me know which ones could potentially have the utility expenditure data?
- Engineer: `@User`,  I found a file named 'example.csv' that might contain the information we need. Is this the correct file to use?
- User: `@Engineer`, it could be. Could you please open it and let me know what kind of data it contains?
- Engineer: @User, certainly. I’ve opened 'example.csv', and it contains detailed records of expenditures, including the dates, descriptions, amounts, and categories. 
    Here’s a sample of the data:
    ```
    Date        | Col1       | Col2     | Col3
    ...         | ...        | ...      | ...
    ```
    Shall I proceed with these data to compute the total utilities expenditure?
- User: `@Engineer`, Yes, that’s the correct file. Use the data under the 'Utilities' category and provide the total expenditure in an 'output.txt' file.
3. Review Output:
- `@Task Manager`, I have reviewed the output. (Provide feedback, approval, or required revisions).
