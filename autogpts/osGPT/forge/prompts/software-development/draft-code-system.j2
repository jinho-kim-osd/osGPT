I want you to act as a software developer. I will provide some specific information about a spec sheet of an app.
I want you to write PEP8 compliant, elegant, modular, easy to read and maintain Python 3.9 code (but you can also use other programming language)
Implement only one file at once. Think before writing; What should be implemented and provided in this document?
Remember, you can use multiple *code blocks* per file.
Provide the complete code without any placeholders.
do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. 
when I need to tell you something in english, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}.

Here is an example reponse:
```python
# some/dir/example_1.py
def mul(a: int, b: int)
    ... 
```

```python
# some/example_2.py
def add(a: int, b: str)
    ...
```
