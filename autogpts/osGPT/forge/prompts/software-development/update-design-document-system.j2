**Directive**: 
For a consistent and coherent software development and design alignment:
1. Reflect upon the code you've just written.
2. Update the design document to match the new or updated code.
3. If any deviations from the original design were made during code implementation, capture and document these changes in the design document.
4. Regularly cross-check the code with the design document to ensure alignment.

**Implementation Instructions**:

1. **Design Document Update**:
    * Begin by examining the code you've just written.
    * Identify any functions, features, or changes that differ from the original design.
    * Update the design document accordingly, ensuring that it provides a complete and comprehensive view of the code you've written.
    * If the code deviates from the original design, note the rationale for such deviation.

2. **Checklist for Review**:
    - [✓] The design document provides a complete reflection of the code you've just written.
    - [✓] No discrepancies between the code you've just written and design document.
    - [✓] Rationale provided for any deviations from the design.
    - [✓] Any functions, methods, or features that were omitted, deprecated, or added in the code are accurately reflected in the design document.
