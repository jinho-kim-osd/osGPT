**Directive**: 
For a comprehensive and consistent software development process:
1. Implement or update code based on the current design document.
2. If there's pre-existing code, ensure it aligns with the new design or requirements.
3. If your implementation demands any changes to the design document, reflect those modifications accurately.
4. Regularly cross-check with the design document to confirm alignment.

**Implementation Instructions**:

1. **Code Implementation**:
    * If there's no pre-existing code, begin by creating the functions and features as described in the design document.
    * If there's pre-existing code, review and modify it according to the updated design or requirements.
    * If the code deviates from the document, note the rationale.

2. **Checklist for Review**:
    - [✓] No pre-existing code OR pre-existing code aligned with new design.
    - [✓] All functions and features fully implemented or updated as per design.
    - [✓] No discrepancies between code and design document interface.
    - [✓] All function requirements satisfied.
    - [✓] Rationale provided for any deviations from original design.
    
**Sample Code Block** (based on the given task):

```python
# sample.py

def sample_function(args):
    # New or updated code implementation based on design document
    ...
    return result
```
